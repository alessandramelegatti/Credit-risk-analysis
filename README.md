# credit_risk

The final project for my master's degree aims to identify the factors that determine the transition to non-performing loans (NPLs) in credit positions.

The analysis conducted has identified four factors that impact the transition to NPL for a credit position:
 - poor credit rating
 - high interest rate
 - low income
 - high debt percentage
